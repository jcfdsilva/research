# Instructions

## Step 1: Prepare the Vanilla Cake

Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C) and grease and line an 8-inch round cake pan.

In a bowl, mix the flour, baking powder, and salt.

In another bowl, cream the butter and sugar until fluffy. Add the egg and vanilla extract and mix well.

Gradually mix in the dry ingredients and milk, alternating between the two, starting and ending with the dry ingredients.

Pour the batter into the pan and bake for 20–25 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted comes out clean. Let it cool.


## Step 2: Make the Mango Custard

In a medium saucepan, whisk together egg yolks, sugar, and cornstarch until smooth.

Gradually add the mango puree, milk, and salt while whisking.

Cook over medium heat, stirring constantly until the mixture thickens (5–7 minutes).

Remove from heat and let it cool, covering it with plastic wrap to prevent a skin from forming.

## Step 3: Prepare the Mango Meringue

Beat the egg whites until soft peaks form.

Gradually add the granulated sugar, one tablespoon at a time, and beat until stiff, glossy peaks form.


## Step 4: Assemble the Cake

Place the vanilla cake layer on a serving platter.

Spread the mango custard evenly over the vanilla cake.

Gently spoon the mango meringue mixture over the custard layer, smoothing it with a spatula.

Burn the meringue with a torch

Chill the assembled cake in the refrigerator for at least 3 hours, or until set.
