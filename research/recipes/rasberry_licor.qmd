## Ingredients

- 250g raspberries
- 250ml Cachaça
- 250g sugar
- 250ml water

## Preparation

1. Wash the raspberies
2. Mix the raspberries and cachaça and let macerate for at least 30 days, while mixing on average once a day
3. Remove the raspberries and save as much liquid as possible
4. Mix the sugar and water in a pan in high heat
5. When it starts to simmer, lower the temperature and let it thicken for around 15min
6. When thickened (but is not caramel) take it out of the heat and let it cool until ~40 degrees C
    - If to hot it will evaporate the alcohol, if too cold it will be hard to mix
7. Mix the sugar mixture and the alchool
8. Leave it again for 30 days and mix on average onc a day
9. Adjust with more cachaça or sugar for personal taste
