## Clustering

Embeddings are vector representations of text, where semantically similar texts are mapped to nearby points in a multidimensional space. In the context of QA document search, embeddings are used to transform both queries and document chunks into vectors, enabling efficient and accurate retrieval of the most relevant information through similarity matching.

Plots with more defined clusters indicate that the embeddings effectively capture the underlying semantic relationships in the data. Well-separated clusters show that similar content is grouped closely together while dissimilar content is pushed apart. This is crucial for QA tasks, as it ensures that queries map to the most relevant document chunks. Clear clusters improve precision and recall by reducing noise and ambiguity in the search process, ultimately leading to faster and more accurate answers.

Here are scatter plots visualizing the embeddings generated by three different models. Each point represents a document chunk, and their positions are determined by reducing the high-dimensional embeddings to two dimensions using PCA. These plots reveal how each model organizes the semantic relationships within the data. Comparing the scatter plots helps us evaluate which model creates better-defined clusters, critical for tasks like QA document search where precise semantic grouping directly impacts retrieval performance.

*The test was made embedding the content of 11 Wikipedia pages (Apollo 11, artificial intelligence, climate change, computers, French revolution, industrial revolution, theory of relativity, Shakespeare, solar system, titanic and World War II) and is executed outside the quarto because it needs API keys - and a few cents are spent for every run*

## Pricing

without embedding the texts, we can use tools to calculate the number of tokens (this depends in multiple factors including the embedding model used)

```{python}
#| eval: false

pdf_files = glob(os.path.join("data", "*.pdf"))

for pdf_path in pdf_files:
    chunks=extract_text_in_chunks(pdf_path)

    print("text-embedding-ada-002 - "+pdf_path+" "+get_nb_tokens(chunks,"cl100k_base"))
    print("text-embedding-3-large - "+pdf_path+" "+get_nb_tokens(chunks,"cl100k_base"))
    print("mini_lm_l12_v2 - "+pdf_path+" "+get_nb_tokens_v2(chunks,'sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L12-v2'))
    print("bge_multilingual_gemma2 - "+pdf_path+" "+get_nb_tokens_v2(chunks,'BAAI/bge-multilingual-gemma2'))

## Retrieval

Retrieval is the process of accessing and extracting relevant information from a dataset or knowledge base in response to a query. In advanced systems like those utilizing vector databases and embedding models, retrieval involves mapping both queries and stored data into a shared semantic space where similarities are measured, often using metrics like cosine similarity. Effective retrieval systems are essential for applications such as question answering, recommendation engines, and information search. They are designed to handle challenges like ambiguity in queries, diverse formats of stored data, and the need for contextual understanding. A robust retrieval mechanism ensures precision, relevance, and scalability, enabling seamless interaction between users and vast repositories of information.

As the content is already embedded with the previous code, we will now test the following questions to retrieve data (and afterwards use the same questions to test LLM's answers):

### How did technological advancements from the Industrial Revolution influence space exploration efforts like Apollo 11?

He also cites the monastic emphasis on order and time-keeping, as well as the fact that medieval cities had at their centre a church with bell ringing at regular intervals as being necessary precursors to a greater synchronisation necessary for later, more physical, manifestations such as the steam engine. The presence of a large domestic market should also be considered an important driver of the Industrial Revolution, particularly explaining why it occurred in Britain.

Five of the sixteen watertight compartments were heavily breached and a sixth was slightly compromised. It soon became clear that Titanic would sink, as the ship could not remain afloat with more than four compartments flooded. Titanic began sinking bow-first, with water spilling from compartment to compartment over the top of each watertight bulkhead as the ship's angle in the water became steeper.[161] Those aboard Titanic were ill-prepared for such an emergency. In accordance with accepted practices of the time, as ships were seen as largely unsinkable and lifeboats were intended to transfer passengers to nearby rescue vessels,[162][k] Titanic only had enough lifeboats to carry about half of those on board; if the ship had carried the full complement of about 3,339 passengers and crew, only about a third could have been accommodated in the lifeboats.[164] The crew had not been trained adequately in carrying out an evacuation. The officers did not know how many they could safely put aboard the lifeboats and launched many of them barely half-full.[165] Third-class passengers were largely left to fend for themselves, causing many of them to become trapped below"

Bradley described this style as "more concentrated, rapid, varied, and, in construction, less regular, not seldom twisted or elliptical".[212] In the last phase of his career, Shakespeare adopted many techniques to achieve these effects. These included run-on lines, irregular pauses and stops, and extreme variations in sentence structure and length.[213] In Macbeth, for example, the language darts from one unrelated metaphor or simile to another: "was the hope drunk/ Wherein you dressed yourself?" (1.7.35–38); "... pity, like a naked new-born babe/ Striding the blast, or heaven\'s cherubim, hors\'d/ Upon the sightless couriers of the air ..." (1.7.21–25). The listener is challenged to complete the sense.[213] The late romances, with their shifts in time and surprising turns of plot, inspired a last poetic style in which long and short sentences are set against one another, clauses are piled up, subject and object are reversed, and words are omitted, creating an effect of spontaneity.[214] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Shakespeare 11/2919/12/2024, 11:23 William Shakespeare - Wikipedia Shakespeare combined poetic genius with a practical sense of the theatre.[215] Like all playwrights of the'

Provides a detailed factual recount of the Titanic disaster, focusing on technical events, such as damage to the ship, lifeboat insufficiencies, and the sinking process. It lacks stylistic elements reminiscent of Shakespeare.

**Classification**: Moderate Context Relevance - *Though not Shakespearean in tone, it contains the essential historical facts needed to discuss the Titanic. The factual narrative gives the system concrete information to work with.*

#### **Text-embedding-3-large**: 
Delves into Shakespeare's writing techniques, including his use of soliloquies, dramatic potential, and his influence on literature. This result focuses on his stylistic and thematic contributions rather than the Titanic itself

**Classification**: Low Context Relevance - *Useful for background on Shakespeare’s style but doesn’t connect with the Titanic tragedy*

#### **Mini_lm_l12_v2**: 
Similar to RESULT2, this focuses on Shakespeare's legacy, stylistic elements, and their influence across literature and other media like opera and film. There are no references to Titanic or any integration of his style with the tragedy.

By comparison, general relativity did not appear to be as useful, beyond making minor corrections to predictions of Newtonian gravitation theory.[3] It seemed to offer little potential for experimental test, as most of its assertions were on an astronomical scale.

Other tests confirmed the equivalence principle and frame dragging. Modern applications Far from being simply of theoretical interest, relativistic effects are important practical engineering concerns. Satellite-based measurement needs to take into account relativistic effects, as each satellite is in motion relative to an Earth-bound user, and is thus in a different frame of reference under the theory of relativity. Global positioning systems such as GPS, GLONASS, and Galileo, must account for all of the relativistic effects in order to work with precision, such as the consequences of the Earth's gravitational field.[24] This is also the case in the high-precision measurement of time.[25] Instruments ranging from electron microscopes to particle accelerators would not work if relativistic considerations were omitted.[26] See also Doubly special relativity Galilean invariance List of textbooks on relativity References 1.

# Had Shakespeare chosen to chronicle the Titanic tragedy, his portrayal might have woven intricate poetic language with deep emotional resonance. He would likely depict the grandeur of the ship, akin to the majestic castles of his time, emphasizing its proud journey across the vast ocean, only to be fatally interrupted by the icy touch of fate—an iceberg, a metaphor for the unforeseen trials that life often presents.

# In a soliloquy akin to Hamlet’s reflections, he might express the despair of those aboard, caught in the throes of panic and confusion. “What folly! To deem our vessel, grand and bejeweled, impervious to death’s cruel embrace! With hearts buoyed by dreams and burdened by hubris, we dance perilously close to the edge of the abyss,” he might lament, encapsulating the sense of invulnerability that blinded many to the looming peril.

# He could illustrate the tragic descent of the ship as a descent into chaos—“Lo! The great Titan bows, her splendor vanquished by a shivering grasp of the deep. What use now are the lifeboats, mere gossamer hopes, afloat in a tempest of human fear?” In this way, Shakespeare would evoke both the physical sinking of the ship and the emotional sinking of spirits, portraying the desperation and isolation experienced by those left behind, especially the third-class passengers.

# The aftermath would likely resonate with themes of loss and regret: “O, cruel fate! How doth it mock our fleeting joys, as the spectral cries of the lost haunt the waves, and remnants of hope drift into the embrace of the sea!” Through eloquent and vivid imagery, he would convey the profound tragedy of a society ill-prepared for disaster—a reflection on human arrogance and the painful lessons etched into memory.

# In his closing lines, he might leave the audience with a poignant contemplation on the nature of existence: “Thus do we stand, humbled before the great unknown, for in our endeavors to conquer the sea’s embrace, we may yet find ourselves ensnared in its grasp.” Such a portrayal would encapsulate the essence of Shakespeare’s style, blending the grandeur of tragedy with the introspection of the human condition.

# ### text-embedding-3-large
# Had Shakespeare penned a play about the Titanic tragedy, he would likely have employed his mastery of characterization and soliloquy to delve deeply into the emotional turmoil and human folly surrounding the disaster. He might have dramatised the events with several centres of interest, weaving together the lives of various passengers—from the wealthy elite in their gilded cabins, reveling in their hubris, to the lower-class immigrants, laden with dreams and hopes of a new life. 

# In his characteristic style, Shakespeare could have introduced a protagonist akin to a tragic hero, perhaps a captain torn between duty and ambition, whose fatal flaw would be a misplaced confidence in the ship’s invincibility. Through captivating soliloquies, this character might reflect on the weight of leadership and the fragility of human life, echoing themes of ambition and fate, reminiscent of Macbeth’s unchecked ambition or Lear’s tragic misjudgments. 

# The emotional impact would be explored not only through the catastrophe itself but also through poignant reflections on love, loss, and the irony of fate—mirroring the doomed romance of “Romeo and Juliet” with star-crossed lovers ensnared by the icy grasp of the Atlantic, their futures slipping away as rapidly as the ship sank. 

# The director's choices, the interplay of light and darkness, the chaos of the sinking ship, and the despair of those left behind would manifest through the dramatic dialogues and rich imagery typical of Shakespearean verse. It could culminate in a haunting conclusion, where the survivors grapple with their own guilt and sorrow, echoing the moral complexities found in his tragedies, and leaving the audience to ponder the question of humanity’s hubris against the merciless forces of nature. 

# Thus, Shakespeare's Titanic tragedy would resonate with themes of ambition, folly, and the ephemeral nature of life, inviting reflection on the human condition amidst a backdrop of disaster.

# ### mini_lm_l12_v2
# If Shakespeare had penned a dramatic account of the Titanic tragedy, he might have employed his characteristic richness of language and depth of character to convey the harrowing events and emotional turmoil of that fateful night. Drawing from his mastery of soliloquies, he could have provided poignant glimpses into the minds of individuals aboard the ship—captains faced with the weight of their decisions, passengers filled with hope and dread, and crew members grappling with their duty versus their humanity.

# He could have depicted the voyage itself as a metaphor for hubris, masterfully weaving themes of ambition and downfall, much like he did in "Macbeth" and "Hamlet." The ship, a grand symbol of modern achievement, would serve as a stark contrast to the chaos that eventually unfolds, echoing the duality he often explored in his characters—noble aspirations tethered to tragic flaws.

# In the climactic moments, Shakespeare might have utilized vivid imagery to portray the sinking vessel, with electric storms reflecting the inner turmoil of the characters. The cries of the doomed might be rendered in lyrical verse, evoking the sorrowful strains of lost dreams. "Alas, what folly to tempt the wrath of the deep," a character might lament, encapsulating the tragedy's inevitability.

# Subsequently, through his deft handling of multiple perspectives, he could have unfolded the impact of the disaster on those left behind—loved ones mourning in the shadows of their lost companions, their anguish a haunting echo reverberating through the annals of time. Shakespeare's exploration of human emotion would delve deep into despair, loss, and the fleeting nature of life, leaving audiences with a lingering sense of tragedy that would resonate through ages, a true testament to the power of the human spirit amidst calamity.

# ### bge_multilingual_gemma2
# Had Shakespeare penned a tragedy about the sinking of the Titanic, the narrative might unfold with the grandeur and gravitas typical of his works. The ship, a "noble vessel, proud and unsinkable," would be depicted as a character embodying humanity's hubris, destined for a cruel fate amidst the icy grasp of the North Atlantic. 

# The opening act may introduce the illustrious Titanic, sailing with great promise from Southampton to New York, filled with patrons of varying fortunes—"lords and ladies, the modest and the grand," all embraced by the glow of hope and ambition. Shakespeare would likely craft a chorus of sailors, warning of the folly in overconfidence: "A vessel girded with watertight chambers, yet not with the wisdom to heed the dark whispers of the ocean."

# As the tale unfolds, the collision with the iceberg would be dramatized with poetic tension, perhaps reminiscent of his tragic heroes grappling with fate. The audience would witness the chaos and despair as the ship strikes the fatal blow, "the heart of the sea piercing the heart of this mighty ship." The emotions would swell as passengers scramble, the stage filled with "the cries of the damned," a cacophony reflecting their desperation and fear, echoing through the night.

# In the aftermath, Shakespeare would explore themes of sacrifice and survival through the lifeboats, filled "but to an average of sixty percent," painting a poignant picture of the human condition—some saved, many lost. Monologues would reflect the inner turmoil of those who remained behind, clinging to the promise of deliverance that never came, their hopes extinguished as "the cruel waves claim their due." A heart-wrenching lamentation would echo across the stage, contemplating the randomness of life and death, "as the grim reaper cuts down the noble and the wretched alike."

# The arrival of the RMS Carpathia would serve as a bittersweet resolution, offering salvation to the few while the sea preserves the memories of the many. In a final act, a reflection on the arbitrary nature of fate and the enduring spirit of those who perished might be expressed, leaving the audience to ponder, long after the curtain falls, the delicate balance between man's aspirations and the indifferent force of nature. 

# Thus, through Shakespeare's eloquent pen, the Titanic tragedy would transform into a timeless tale of human folly, resilience, and the somber reflection on lives intertwined in a fleeting moment of history.

# ### text-embedding-ada-002
# The principles of relativity, particularly those outlined in Einstein's theories, provide a fascinating framework for understanding concepts of time travel in popular science fiction, such as in 'Doctor Who'. 

# 1. **Relativity of Simultaneity**: This principle suggests that two events that appear simultaneous in one frame of reference may not be so in another. In 'Doctor Who', characters often experience time differently based on their relative speeds or positions in the universe, which can lead to situations where different timelines or events do not align as expected.

# 2. **Time Dilation**: According to special relativity, moving clocks tick more slowly compared to stationary ones. This concept is often exploited in 'Doctor Who', where time can be experienced at different rates while traveling in the TARDIS. For instance, a character might explore various locations across time and space but experience only a short duration of time themselves, while others age or experience longer spans of time.

# 3. **Length Contraction**: Another intriguing aspect of relativity is that an object moving at a significant fraction of the speed of light will appear shorter in the direction of motion. While 'Doctor Who' tends to focus on the narrative of time travel, this principle enhances the perception of alien worlds and travel, where distances and dimensions might bend, enhancing the sci-fi element.

# 4. **Maximum Speed and Information Transfer**: The idea that nothing can travel faster than light is a fundamental aspect of both relativity and 'Doctor Who'. The TARDIS, while seemingly able to traverse time and space instantaneously, might still operate within these physical limitations, creatively presenting time travel as a mysterious yet potentially physics-based phenomenon.

# 5. **Mass-Energy Equivalence**: The famous equation E=mc² could also be conceptually linked to the idea of transforming mass and energy during time travel. In 'Doctor Who', characters sometimes deal with the consequences of manipulating energy and matter, impacting their journeys or the realities they encounter.

# In conclusion, while 'Doctor Who' employs the fantastical notion of time travel, it can draw from the realities presented in the theory of relativity to create complex narratives that reflect on space, time, and existence, allowing for rich storytelling interwoven with scientific principles.

# ### text-embedding-3-large
# The principles from the theory of relativity can significantly inform the concept of time travel as depicted in popular science fiction, such as in ‘Doctor Who’. Key elements of the theory, including time dilation, the relativity of simultaneity, and the idea of spacetime, are particularly relevant.

# 1. **Time Dilation**: In relativity, moving clocks are observed to tick more slowly compared to stationary clocks. This principle suggests that if a character in ‘Doctor Who’ travels at speeds close to the speed of light, they could experience time at a different rate than those remaining stationary. This could explain scenarios where a time traveller ages slower than their friends and family.

# 2. **Relativity of Simultaneity**: This principle posits that two events that are simultaneous for one observer may not be for another in relative motion. In 'Doctor Who', this could allow for complex narratives where the Doctor and companions encounter events or characters at different points in time, illustrating how their experiences of time differ due to their movements.

# 3. **Spacetime and Maximum Speed**: The theory emphasizes that nothing can travel faster than the speed of light, which forms a boundary on how time travel might theoretically work. In ‘Doctor Who’, the TARDIS, which travels through time and space, can be seen as a creative interpretation of how such limitations might be circumvented—perhaps suggesting advanced technology that manipulates spacetime itself.

# 4. **Mass-Energy Equivalence**: The famous equation E=mc² implies that mass and energy are interchangeable. In the context of time travel, one could speculate that immense energy might be required to manipulate spacetime significantly enough to navigate across time, aligning with countless plots where energy sources are crucial for the Doctor's time travel.

# These principles not only enrich the storytelling in ‘Doctor Who’ but also allow viewers to engage with complex scientific ideas within a popular and entertaining framework. The relativity concepts create a bridge between speculative fiction and scientific theory, giving depth to the fantastical elements of time travel.

# ### mini_lm_l12_v2
# The principles from the theory of relativity, particularly those introduced by Albert Einstein, can significantly inform the concept of time travel as depicted in popular science fiction, such as in ‘Doctor Who’. 

# Firstly, special relativity, which articulates the relationship between space and time, suggests that time is not a constant but is relative and can be affected by speed. This concept is often leveraged in science fiction to propose that traveling at very high speeds could allow characters to experience time differently, thereby enabling time travel. For example, in ‘Doctor Who’, the TARDIS travels through time and space, suggesting a manipulation of the spacetime continuum, a notion derived from Einstein's theories.

# Moreover, general relativity expands on these concepts by explaining how gravity can influence the passage of time. In this framework, near massive objects, time dilates -- meaning time moves slower in strong gravitational fields compared to areas of weaker gravity. This principle finds resonance in stories where characters may experience varying rates of time passage depending on their proximity to gravitational wells, which could lead to scenarios where one travels to the future while others age normally.

# Additionally, the idea of a 4-dimensional spacetime, as introduced in the theory, provides a foundation for the visualization of time travel. It implies that time could be navigated similarly to how one navigates through space. This premise is often creatively explored in ‘Doctor Who’, where time is treated as a navigable dimension, allowing the characters to visit different eras and events.

# In summary, the principles of relativity, particularly the relativity of simultaneity, kinematic time dilation, and the concept of spacetime, form a scientific basis that enriches the narrative of time travel in ‘Doctor Who’ and other science fiction stories, providing a plausible framework for the fantastical elements of temporal exploration.

# ### bge_multilingual_gemma2
# The principles from the theory of relativity, particularly those introduced by Albert Einstein, provide a fascinating framework for understanding concepts of time travel often explored in popular science fiction like ‘Doctor Who’. 

# 1. **Relativity of Simultaneity**: In 'Doctor Who', time travel often involves characters experiencing events in non-linear sequences. This concept aligns with the relativity of simultaneity, which states that two events perceived as simultaneous by one observer may not appear the same to another in relative motion. This principle can explain the complexities of timelines and events occurring out of sync for different characters in the series.

# 2. **Time Dilation**: The theory of relativity posits that moving clocks tick more slowly compared to stationary ones. In science fiction narratives, characters traveling at high velocities—such as the Doctor and the TARDIS—might experience time differently compared to those remaining in a stationary position, further emphasizing the alterations in time perception during travel.

# 3. **Length Contraction**: As objects move closer to the speed of light, they experience length contraction. This effect could theoretically be incorporated into methods used for time travel in 'Doctor Who', where the TARDIS's movement through time and space might involve such relativistic effects, leading to unique spatial and temporal experiences for the travellers.

# 4. **Mass-Energy Equivalence (E = mc²)**: Through this principle, the relationship between mass and energy might be envisioned in 'Doctor Who' as part of the mechanics of the TARDIS, where energy is necessary for moving through time and space, signifying that significant energy is required for time travel.

# 5. **Practical Engineering Concerns**: The integration of relativistic effects, like those seen in real-world applications such as GPS satellites, could inspire fictional technologies within ‘Doctor Who,’ providing a scientific foundation on which the fantastical elements of time travel are built. The precision required for navigating through time would necessitate an understanding of these relativistic effects, mirroring real-world implications of relativistic physics in technology.

# In summary, the principles of the theory of relativity not only provide a scientific root for the fantastical elements of time travel in 'Doctor Who' but also introduce intriguing concepts that challenge our understanding of time, space, and motion in narrative form.
